for this project we use a YOLOV1 Model and the weights were learned in google colab for 30 min only on 433  plate picture and 4952 background image  do the model can sometime 
act poorly due to the lack of data (i kinda handle it with sampler but not as much effective as new data) and weigths in colab
this is my first project don't act harsh about it and sorry for all missunderestanding for the comment's in code especially in loss.py (which was hard to learn and write)
